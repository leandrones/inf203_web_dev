Question 1a:
We can see that in the Inspector Element we have got some 
more options concerning the manipulation of the page. Also,
we can see the basic tags <html> and <body>, which are not 
displayed on the source code page.

Question 1b:
We need only use <b> tag.

Question 1c:
On the top of the tab on the browser, the title is 
displayed.
The html basic structure is a composition of a <html> root 
node, followed by the <head> node, that possesses metadata such
as the title parameter, but also the script or style tags.
Then we have the body node that will show the content viewed by the
user inside the web page itself.
Writing the html head and body are optional in a html file.

Question 1d:


Question 1e:

Question 1f:
Not closing the h1 tag makes all the text as a 
header,big and bold. The <a> tag inside nav does not 
need to be closed and it does not cause visualization issues

Question 2a:


Question 2b:
You have to specify an id or a class for every div tag.
The disadvantege is that it is worse if you want to personalize
each element differently.
But the advantage is that it is much easier for code refactoring,
since you have all the style settings on the same place.

Question 2c:
We have to add a link tag on the head tag with the css file path.
The advantage is also to let the code more organized and not let
the files get too big.
